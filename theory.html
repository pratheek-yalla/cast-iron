                <li><h2>Theory</h2></li>
                <li>Cast iron is made when pig iron is remelted in small cupola furnaces (similar to the blast furnace in design and
                operation) and poured into molds to make castings. Cast Iron is generally defined as an alloy of Iron with greater than
                2% Carbon, and usually with more than 0.1% Silicon.</li>
                <li>The term cast iron, like the term steel, identifies a large family of ferrous alloys. Cast irons are multi component
                ferrous alloys. They contain major (iron, carbon, silicon), minor (<0.01%), and often alloying (>0.01%) elements. Cast
                    iron has higher carbon and silicon contents than steel. Because of the higher carbon content, the structure of cast
                    iron, as opposed to that of steel, exhibits a rich carbon phase.</li><br>
                <li><h3>Types of Cast Iron:</h3></li>
                <li>On the basis of Microstructure cast irons are classified as follows.</li>
                <li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>White Cast Iron</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Composition of the iron is appropriate or the cooling rate of the metal is sufficiently rapid during solidification, the
                                metal will solidify with the C combined with iron as iron carbide. This compound, also called cementite, is hard and
                                brittle and dominates the microstructure of white iron. Thus, white iron is hard and brittle and has a white crystalline
                                fracture because it is essentially free of graphite. White iron has a high compressive strength and excellent wear
                                resistance, and it retains its hardness for limited periods even up to a red heat
                                White iron does not have the easy castabiiity of other irons because its solidification temperature is generally higher,
                                and it solidifies with C in its combined form as iron carbide. Application includes rollers of rolling mills, Dies of
                                metal extrusion and where high wear resistance is necessary.</li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Gray Cast Iron</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Gray Cast Irons contain silicon, in addition to carbon, as a primary alloy. Amounts of manganese are also added to yield
                                the desired microstructure. Generally the graphite exists in the form of flakes, which are surrounded by an aferrite or
                                Pearlite matrix. Most Gray Irons are hypoeutectic, meaning they have carbon equivalence (C.E.) of less than 4.3. Gray
                                cast irons are comparatively weak and brittle in tension due to its microstructure; the graphite flakes have tips which
                                serve as points of stress concentration. Strength and ductility are much higher under compression loads.
                                The properties of gray iron are influenced by the size, amount and distribution of the graphite flakes, and by the
                                relative hardness of the matrix metal around the graphite. These factors are controlled mainly by the C and Si contents
                                of the metal and the cooling rate of the casting.</li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Ductile Cast Iron</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ductile iron also referred to as nodular iron or spheroidal graphite iron, was patented in 1948.                                
                                An unusual combination of properties is obtained in ductile iron because the graphite occurs as spheroids rather than as
                                individual flakes as in gray iron. This mode of solidification is obtained by adding a very small, but specific, amount
                                of Mg to molten iron of a proper composition. The base iron is severely restricted in the allowable contents of certain
                                minor elements that can interfere with the graphite spheroid formation. The added Mg reacts with the sulfur and oxygen
                                in the molten iron and changes the way the graphite is formed
                                Ductile iron, like malleable iron, exhibits a linear stress-strain relation, a considerable range of yield strengths
                                and, as its name implies, ductility. Castings are made in a wide range of sizes with sections that can be either very
                                thin or very thick.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="./images/Ductile_Iron.png" style="width: 30%; display: block; margin: auto;">
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Malleable Cast Iron</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This type of iron is characterized by having the majority of its C content occur in the microstructure as irregularly
                                shaped nodules of graphite. This form of graphite is called temper carbon because it is formed in the solid state during
                                heat treatment. The iron is cast as a white iron of a suitable chemical composition. After the castings are removed from
                                the mold, they are given an extended heat treatment starting at a temperature above 1650°F (900°C). This causes the iron
                                carbide to dissociate and the free carbon precipitates in the solid iron as graphite. The rapid 22 solidification rate
                                that is necessary to form the white iron limits the metal thickness in the casting that is practical for the malleable
                                iron process.
                                Malleable irons containing some combined carbon in the matrix often are referred to as pearlitic malleable, although the
                                microstructure may be martensitic or a spheroidized pearlite.</li>

                            <b>Compacted Graphite Iron</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Iron-carbon cast material with the carbon proportion being present as graphite, predominantly in vermicular (compacted)
                                form. This structural appearance in the micrograph makes for the name Compacted graphite iron Compacted graphite iron
                                (CGI) can be considered as a promising engineering material which contains graphite particles in compacted (vermicular)
                                form. CGI shows intermediate mechanical and physical properties between grey and ductile irons. For instance, it
                                possesses 70% higher tensile strength, 35% higher elastic modulus and nearly double fatigue strength of grey cast irons.
                                Thus it includes an optimal combination of different properties like strength, ductility and thermal conductivity which
                                have lead to a distinctive attention during recent years. Because of these properties, CGI found a significant role in
                                production of automotive engines, machine parts and also many different applications. Nowadays, several methods of
                                casting of CGI products have been developed, trying to find the best method to have a precise control on the final
                                microstructure.</li>
