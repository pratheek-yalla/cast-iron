            <li>As many cast irons tend to corrode, cleaning must be fast and should always be carried out with cold water. However, the sample must not be left in contact with water.</li>
            <li>Thorough rinsing with ethanol and fast drying with a strong stream of warm air is recommended. If corrosion still occurs, clean and rinse with water-free alcohol only.</li>
