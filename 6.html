            <li>Cast iron samples are initially microscopically
            examined unetched to evaluate the shape, size and
            distribution of graphite, as well as cast porosity.
            After this initial evaluation of the microstructure,
            the sample can be etched for microstructure with
            1-3 % Nital.</li>
            <li>Cast irons with graphite are not suitable for
            electrolytic polishing as the graphite is washed
            away by the electrolyte. However, if only a quick
            identification of the microstructure of the matrix is
            required, electrolytic polishing and etching can be
            used.</li>
